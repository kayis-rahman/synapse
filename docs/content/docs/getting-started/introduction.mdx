# Introduction

**SYNAPSE** is a local-first RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that connects your knowledge to AI.

## What is SYNAPSE?

SYNAPSE implements a neurobiological metaphor for knowledge management:
- **Neurons**: Your stored documents and knowledge
- **Dendrites**: Semantic memory (vector-based retrieval)
- **Synapses**: Episodic memory (lessons from experience)
- **Cell Bodies**: Symbolic memory (authoritative facts)
- **Synaptic Firing**: The process of retrieving and injecting knowledge into AI responses

## Why Local-First?

- **Privacy**: Your data never leaves your system
- **Control**: Complete ownership of your knowledge base
- **Offline**: Works without internet connection
- **Customizable**: Adapt to your specific use case

## Quick Example

```bash
# Start SYNAPSE MCP Server
synapse-mcp-server

# Query your knowledge base
synapse query "How does the memory system work?"
```

Next: [Installation](./installation)
