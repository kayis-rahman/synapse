# Testing

SYNAPSE includes comprehensive tests for all components.

## Test Structure

```
tests/
 ├── test_memory.py         # Memory system tests
 ├── test_ingestion.py       # Ingestion tests
 ├── test_retrieval.py      # Retrieval tests
 └── test_integration.py     # Integration tests
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_memory.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=rag --cov-report=html

# Watch mode (re-run on file changes)
pytest-watch
```

## Memory System Tests

Test symbolic, episodic, and semantic memory:

```bash
pytest tests/test_memory.py -v
```

### Test Coverage

- ✅ Symbolic memory CRUD operations
- ✅ Episodic memory storage and retrieval
- ✅ Semantic memory ingestion and search
- ✅ Memory selector authority hierarchy
- ✅ Cross-memory type queries

## Integration Tests

Test end-to-end workflows:

```bash
pytest tests/test_integration.py -v
```

### Test Coverage

- ✅ Complete RAG pipeline
- ✅ MCP tool execution
- ✅ Bulk ingestion workflow
- ✅ Memory type interactions

## CI/CD

Tests run automatically on:

- Pull requests
- Pushes to main branch
