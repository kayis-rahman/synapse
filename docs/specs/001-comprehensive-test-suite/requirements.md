# Comprehensive Test Suite - Requirements Specification

## Executive Summary

**Feature ID**: 001-comprehensive-test-suite
**Status**: In Progress
**Created**: January 4, 2026

**Objective**: Build comprehensive pytest test suite covering unit, integration, and end-to-end testing for SYNAPSE RAG system to achieve 70%+ overall code coverage and ensure system reliability.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- **Test Infrastructure**: ✅ Established (conftest.py, pytest.ini)
- **Test Coverage**: 149 tests collected (56 passing, 57 failed, 5 errors)
- **Source Code**: 15,444 lines across rag/, synapse/, mcp_server/, scripts/
- **Test Code**: 5,281 lines

### Critical Gaps Identified
1. **Broken Tests** (3 test files with errors)
   - `test_memory_writer.py` - Syntax error on line 9
   - `test_prompt_builder.py` - Import error (missing function)
   - `test_rag_pipeline.py` - Module not found

2. **Missing Unit Tests** (17 RAG modules)
   - bulk_ingest, chroma_semantic_store, chroma_vectorstore
   - episode_extractor, episodic_reader
   - memory_formatter, memory_selector
   - orchestrator, query_cache
   - semantic_ingest, semantic_injector, semantic_retriever
   - vectorstore, vectorstore_base, vectorstore_factory

3. **Missing CLI Module Tests** (8 modules)
   - ingest, query, start, stop, status, models, setup, onboard

4. **Missing MCP Server Tests** (6 modules)
   - rag_server, http_wrapper, project_manager
   - chroma_manager, metrics, production_logger

5. **Incomplete Integration Tests**
   - Full RAG pipeline (ingest → retrieve → generate)
   - MCP server tool integration
   - CLI command orchestration
   - Memory tier coordination

6. **Missing E2E Tests**
   - Complete user workflows (setup → ingest → query)
   - MCP client integration
   - Error recovery paths
   - Performance benchmarks

### Impact
- **Reliability**: Cannot guarantee system works correctly
- **Maintainability**: No safety net for code changes
- **Confidence**: No assurance of quality before releases
- **Onboarding**: Difficult for contributors to understand expected behavior

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly **out of scope** for this feature:

- **Testing external dependencies** (llama-cpp-python, ChromaDB)
- **Performance optimization** (only benchmarking, no optimization)
- **Test framework migration** (staying with pytest)
- **Browser/automated UI testing** (no GUI components)
- **Load/stress testing** (beyond basic performance benchmarks)
- **Security testing** (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning)
- **Compliance testing** (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

---

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- pytest (test framework)
- pytest-cov (coverage reporting)
- pytest-asyncio (async test support)
- pytest-xdist (parallel test execution)

### Internal Dependencies
- All RAG modules must be functional
- All CLI commands must be implemented
- All MCP server tools must be implemented
- Test fixtures must be defined in conftest.py

### Blockers
- None identified

---

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Flaky Tests
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation**:
- Use mocking for external dependencies
- Fix deterministic seed values in tests
- Identify and eliminate non-deterministic code paths

### Risk 2: Slow Test Execution
**Likelihood**: High
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Use mocks for external services (embedding, LLM)
- Run unit tests in parallel (pytest-xdist)
- Mark slow tests with @pytest.mark.slow marker

### Risk 3: Test Maintenance Overhead
**Likelihood**: High
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Write maintainable, self-documenting tests
- Use reusable fixtures and utilities
- Document test patterns in test suite README

### Risk 4: Incomplete Coverage
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation**:
- Set up coverage thresholds in CI/CD
- Review coverage reports regularly
- Focus on critical modules first
