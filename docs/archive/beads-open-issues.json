    "description": "Update the Fumadocs installation documentation page with Docker-first approach, CLI commands, and all installation options. Current Status: DOCKER_INSTALLATION.md created (comprehensive) but docs/getting-started/installation.mdx still shows pip-only installation. Implementation Plan: 1) Read current docs/content/docs/getting-started/installation.mdx, 2) Add Docker Hub installation as primary option (copy from DOCKER_INSTALLATION.md), 3) Add Docker Compose as secondary option, 4) Keep pip and source as alternatives, 5) Add CLI Commands section with neurobiological commands (synapse-ignite, synapse-sense, synapse-feed), 6) Add 'Choosing an Installation Method' comparison table, 7) Update Quick Start code examples, 8) Add links to DOCKERHUB_SETUP.md and DOCKER_INSTALLATION.md. Design Notes: Fumadocs uses MDX with frontmatter (title, description), Maintain consistency with other docs pages, Use code fences for commands, Add icons/emojis for visual appeal. Content Structure: Title, Description, Option 1: Docker Hub (primary), Option 2: Docker Compose, Option 3: pip, Option 4: Source, CLI Commands, Comparison Table, Next Steps. Expected Changes: ~50-80 lines added, installation.mdx grows from ~36 to ~120 lines. File Path: docs/content/docs/getting-started/installation.mdx. Estimated: 30 min. Validation: Installation page shows all 4 methods with Docker first, CLI commands documented, no broken links to other docs, frontmatter format correct.",
