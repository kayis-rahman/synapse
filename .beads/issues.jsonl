Design Notes: Create test script for automated smoke testing, Test matrix: Docker Hub, Docker Compose, pip, source, Test scenarios: Startup, ingestion, querying, health checks, CLI commands. Success Criteria: All MCP tools respond correctly, CLI wrappers execute without errors, Health endpoint returns 200 OK, Version matches 1.0.0 everywhere, No broken documentation links, Docker image runs on both platforms (if available). Known Risks: Multi-platform build may fail on ARM64 (limited testing), Docker Hub credentials not configured, MCP tool parameters may need updates. Estimated: 2 hours.
